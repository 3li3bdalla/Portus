It's been quite some time since we released 2.3.2, so it's about time to
introduce a new patch-level release: 2.3.3! This release comes with a set of
important bug fixes:

- We have fixed a couple of bugs around SSL support for LDAP connections (which
  had some side-effects as well like
  [#1746](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1746) and
  [#1774](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1774)).
- We have fixed another bug on LDAP support, in which sometimes Portus crashed
  when trying to guess an email (see
  [#1832](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1832)).
- Portus will now use a more fine-grained scope for Github authentications (see
  [#1790](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1790)).
- Clair support has been enhanced, so it performs better on flaky connections
  (e.g. connections with frequent time outs). See
  [#1743](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1743) and
  [#1751](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1751).
- The synchronization task from the background process has been improved so
  Portus won't remove all repositories when some errors happen.

The [2.3 tag from the official Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/portus/) has already been updated, so
you can already pull this image and benefit from these fixes.

### Words of warning

Commits
[45814babef7e](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/commit/45814babef7e99a3ade7ee734a0be4a6f0f5f078)
and
[4892eb1dc5ce](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/commit/4892eb1dc5cef9768d6e3d336c17568667d23079)
introduce some new options for LDAP. In particular, the following options have
been added inside of the `ldap` configuration:

```yaml
  # Encryption options
  encryption:
    # Available methods: "plain", "simple_tls" and "start_tls".
    method: ""
    options:
      # The CA file to be accepted by the LDAP server. If none is provided, then
      # the default parameters from the host will be sent.
      ca_file: ""

      # Protocol version.
      ssl_version: "TLSv1_2"
```

Notice that the old `ldap.method` is getting deprecated and in later versions it
will be removed. Thus, you should use these options from now on.

### What's next

All these fixes are also available inside of the
[master](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/commits/master) branch, together with a
bunch of new features and shiny improvements. We expect to start the release
process for `2.4` between the end of June and the beginning of July. So... stay
tuned!
