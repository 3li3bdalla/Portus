As you have probably noticed, some weeks ago we released 2.3.1, and today we
just released 2.3.2. These releases tackle two CVEs affecting a couple of
dependencies from Portus:

- [CVE-2018-8048](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8048):
  which affects the `loofah` gem.
- [CVE-2018-3741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3741):
  which affects the `rails-html-sanitizer` gem.

These releases are just about upgrading these two gems to secure versions: there
are no code changes.

## The Docker image

The `2.3` and the `latest` tags from the [official Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/portus/) are already pointing to the
2.3.2 release, so a simple `docker pull` should get you covered.
