This new patch-level release includes some important fixes, so we recommend
everyone using this branch to upgrade as soon as possible. In particular, this
release includes the following fixes and enhancements:

- More things can be configured with environment variables for the deployment of
  Portus. See the pull request
  [#1880](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/pull/1880).
- We added more protection around the portus hidden user. This user is meant for
  background purposes, so it doesn't make sense to update it in any way (besides
  changing the password, which has been protected as well). See the pull request
  [#1896](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/pull/1896).
- Containerized deployments are now properly detected by `portusctl`. Note that
  this version of `portusctl` being fixed is the one included on the `v2.3`
  branch, not [the new one](https://github.com/openSUSE/portusctl). See the pull
  request [#1879](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/pull/1879).
- Thanks to [@kiorky](https://github.com/kiorky), a couple of fixes around
  Gitlab OAuth support have also been included. See the pull request
  [#1903](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/pull/1903).

### Changing the password of the portus hidden user

Before this patch-level release, changing the password of this hidden user
involved performing some updates on the database and being really careful. This
is no longer the case now: you can simply change the value of the secret
containing this password and Portus will automatically update the password on
start. This means that you will have to restart Portus whenever you decide to
change the value of this secret.

### What's next

All these fixes are also available inside of the
[master](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/commits/master) branch, together with a
bunch of new features and shiny improvements. The release process for `2.4` has
been delayed a bit more than anticipated, but once we are done with the latest
feature that we want to include, we will start a code freeze and then the new
release will be out as soon as possible.
