Hello!

It's my pleasure to write the first post on the Portus' blog. In this blog
we will try to communicate as much as possible regarding our plans for the
future, new features and other exciting news.

For this post, we've been honored to be one of the projects selected to
represent [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org) in the [Google Summer of
Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) program (or GSoC, for
short). You can see more projects inside of the openSUSE umbrella
[here](http://101.opensuse.org/). We think that the Google Summer of Code
program is the perfect opportunity for students to dive into Free Software and
meet the people involved in Free Software products. In our case, we want to
present to you [Matheus Fernandes](http://msfernandes.github.io/), a student
from Brazil that is giving Portus a nicer look and a more usable experience. If
you want to know him more and what he will be working on, don't hesitate and
read his first blog post on his first Google Summer of Code [blog
post](http://msfernandes.github.io/blog/2016/05/29/GSoC). We are really proud
to have him in board and we expect great things coming from him!

That has been all for the first post of this blog. Stay tuned for more news!
