We start the year with a couple of patch-level releases. First of all, we have
`2.3.7`, in which we upgraded some Ruby gems that had known vulnerability
issues. Therefore, we strongly recommend users that are still on the `v2.3`
branch to switch to this new version.

Besides that, we released `2.4.0` in October, and meanwhile we've been
accumulating fixes for bugs that the community has been reporting. Now we felt
like it was a good time to release all these fixes into a new release, and hence
we deliver to you `2.4.1`. You can read the list of bugs that have been fixed
[here](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/releases/tag/2.4.1).

The `2.4` and the `2.3` Docker tags have been updated accordingly on the Docker
hub, and you can also pull from the specific tags `2.4.1` and `2.3.7`.

Last but not least, we are releasing these two releases on a time in which we
are pretty close of the deadline for the code freeze for `2.5.0`. This release
will improve upon the previous releases with all the feedback that we've
gathered from the community, and we are pretty excited about. So stay tuned!
