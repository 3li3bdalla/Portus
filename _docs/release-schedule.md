## Release schedule for 2.4

We plan to have a shorter development cycle for the 2.4 release. That's because
we spent too much time without doing an actual release and users were
complaining that they couldn't grab a stable release which included some needed
features.

The plan for this release is:

- On June we will have a code freeze, so no new features will be allowed after
  that.
- Then we will be releasing release candidates until we have something
  stable.

Our plan for the 2.4 release can bee seen [here](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/milestone/17).
