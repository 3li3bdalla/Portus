## Release schedule for 2.5

We plan to have an even shorter development cycle for the 2.5 release. The 2.4
release didn't take as long as other releases, but we still think that we can do
faster and smaller iterations.

The plan for this release is:

- At the end of January 2019 we will have a code freeze, so no new features will
  be allowed after that.
- Then we will be releasing release candidates until we have something
  stable.

Our plan for the 2.5 release can bee seen
[here](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/projects/3).
