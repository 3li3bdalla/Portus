## Starring repositories

Portus allows any user to star any accessible repository. This is meant to be
used to reflect which repositories you care the most, so they can be accessed
faster later. You can star repositories by just clicking the star that is on
the top right corner of a repository page. Just like this:

You can check the repositories that you have starred in the dashboard page:
