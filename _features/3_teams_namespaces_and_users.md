## Teams

Teams are the way in which an organization can manage sets of users. Each team
owns a set of namespaces, which are used to group repositories. Besides grouping
namespaces, teams are used to manage the permissions in which each team member
can push/pull certain repositories. This is done through
[team roles](/features/3_teams_namespaces_and_users.html#team-roles).

The UI for managing teams is quite simple. First, you can go to the "Teams"
page and you will see something similar to this:

![Creating a team](/images/docs/create-team.png)

In the previous image you can see the form for creating a new team. Moreover,
this page will list the teams in which the current user is a member. If you
click to one of the teams, then you will go to this team's page. In there
you can see listed the team members and the list of owned namespaces. It
should be something similar to this:

![The team page](/images/docs/team-show.png)

In the previous image, the current user was the owner of the team. Therefore,
some UI elements are available to this user:

- A widget that will allow us to edit the team role of each user.
- A button that will allow us to remove a certain user.

### Team roles

The way to handle permissions within a team is by establishing roles for each
team member. Roles are managed by team owners, and they are as follows:

- **Viewer**: viewers can only pull from the repositories owned by the team.
- **Contributor**: contributors can both pull and push from the repositories
  owned by the team.
- **Owner**: owners have the same permissions as contributors, but they can
  also manage the list of team members. Owners can: add/remove team members and
  edit the role of team members.

## Namespaces

A `namespace` is simply a collection of repositories. Namespaces are the way in
which Portus is able to manage repositories in a friendly and clear way. Each
namespace belongs to a team. As we have seen in the
[section about teams](/features/3_teams_namespaces_and_users.html#teams), teams
are the responsible for setting the push and pull permissions. Therefore,
namespaces don't have to deal with permissions, they are just a tool for teams
to aggregate repositories. Of course, each team can have multiple namespaces.

### Kinds of namespaces

Namespaces group repositories, but we have to have in mind that there are
multiple types of namespaces. This is because besides team-owned namespaces,
there are two more kinds of namespaces that are a bit special: the global
namespace and personal namespaces. More clearly:

| Kind | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Global | The one that belongs to the registry. | Only admin users can push. Everyone can pull. |
| Team | The ones that belong to a team. | Defined by the [team](/features/3_teams_namespaces_and_users.html#team-roles). |
| Personal | Each user has its own namespace. | Only the user and administrators can push/pull. |

The global namespace gets created when installing Portus, after a registry has
been created (see more about this [here](/docs/Configuring-the-registry.html)).
The personal namespace gets created when the user signs up.

Moreover, a namespace can be **public**. A public namespace can be pulled by
anyone, regardless if the user is logged in or not. This can be useful to allow
a set of repositories to be accessible to anyone outside of the organization.

### The Web interface for namespaces

There are two main things that an user can do on the web site regarding
namespaces:

1. Creating a new namespace.
2. Listing all the repositories from a given namespace.

There are two ways of creating a namespace: one from the "Namespaces" tab,
and the other from the "Teams" tab. In the "Namespaces" tab, you do this
by clicking on the link on the top right corner that says
"Create new namespace", as you can see in the following snapshot:

![Creating a namespace](/images/docs/create-namespace2.png)

In order to do this from the "Teams" tab, the owner of the team has to click
on the team in which the owner wants to create said namespace. Once this is
done, the owner will just have to click on the link on the top right corner
that says "Add namespace", as you can see in the following snapshot:

![Creating a namespace from the Team page](/images/docs/create-namespace1.png)

Note that only owners of a team can create new namespaces. Finally, in order
to show the repositories that are accessible from a namespace, the user
should go to the "Namespaces" tab and click on one of the listed namespaces.
Note that this list gives all the namespaces in which the current user has
access to. In order to list the namespaces from a specific team, one has to
go the "Teams" tab and click on the wanted team. The page of a namespace
just shows the repositories contained in each given namespace, and how many
tags does the repository have. For example:

![The namespace page](/images/docs/namespace-show.png)

## Users

### Adding more admin users

Only the admin user can add more administrators to the system. In order to do
it, the admin has to click the "Admin" tab, and then click "Users" in one of
the top containers. Then, the admin should be seeing something similar to this:

![Adding admin users](/images/docs/toggle-admin.png)

This page contains a list of all the users registered in the system. By
toggling the switch under the "Admin" label, the admin can give admin
permissions to different users.
