## Audit

One additional feature of Portus is that it monitors and registers all the
activities that users perform on the application. It registers the following
kinds of actions:

- A team has added/removed a member.
- A team has changed the permissions of a member.
- A namespace has been created.
- A namespace has been made public/private.
- The description of a team/namespace has been edited.
- A repository has been pushed.

All this information is stored in the database, so it can be visualized later
on in either the "Activities" tab or the "Admin" one. The "Activities" tab
is the one selected when you first enter in Portus and it shows all the
activities that are relevant to the current user. An example:

![Current user activities](/images/docs/activities-admin.png)

As a comparison, imagine that we have a user that has not been added to the
"Machinery" team (as you can see in the previous picture, this was the case for
that user). In this case, this is what the user would see:

![Current user activities](/images/docs/activities-user.png)

The "Admin" page shows some statistics about the application, and in the bottom
you can see a list of activities. This list differs from the one that you can
see in the "Activities" tab by listing all the activities, regardless if it's
relevant to the current user or not. Therefore, an admin user will always have
the possibility of monitoring the actions of all the users in this application.
However, this page is limited to 20 activities. If you want to view all the
activities, you'll have to click at the link saying "View all activities". If
you click this, you'll find the following:

![Admin activities](/images/docs/activities-csv.png)

As you can see, this is the same list as the one shown in the admin page, but
this one is not limited to 20 activities. Moreover, as you can see, in the
top right corner there is a button for downloading a CSV file with all the
activities. The downloaded data is suitable to be used with spreadsheet
applications.
